                    Otherwise know as "percebes" are the claw-footed, lobstery
                    little crustaceans youâ€™ll fall madly in love with, if you
                    just give them a chance. This seafood is among the most
                    expensive in the world and can go for as much as $125 a
                    pound. They are filter feeders that are dependent on water
                    movement for feeding. In many places in the world they are a
                    delicacy, in fact, back in the day, any ships arriving in
                    Cornwall, England with gooseneck barnacles on the hull were
                    a real moneyspinner. The gooseneck barnacles would be
                    scraped from the hull and sold for food. They live attached
                    to the hard surfaces of rocks and flotsam in the ocean.
